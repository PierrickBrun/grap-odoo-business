* It should be great to split this module into many modules, with some generic
  features in a module named product_to_scale and some specifics features
  for each scales system. 'product_to_scale_bizerba',
  'product_to_scale_metler_toledo', etc.

* Improve description, adding features and screenshots.

* When migrating, recover commits like this one:
